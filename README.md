# Local Nonprofits (App in DRAFT)

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://johnzelson-local-nonprofits-graph-streamlit-app-zuq6hl.streamlit.app/)

An early draft streamlit app that visualizes connections between people, nonprofit organizations, and emphasis area around a local area (Cortland, NY)

The visualization app is an offshoot of a project to find ways of presenting info on local community in a way that will be fun, maybe find some collaborators, and 
generally learn about community.

Data Sources:
- IRS Business Master File (BMF) of "active" nonprofits
- IRS Tax Returns (Form 990-series)
- Census
- Congress API
- Censusreporter
- Probublica

The data is processed in several google colab notebooks from [np-colab-notebooks](https://github.com/johnzelson/np-colab-notebooks)
